# Hi !
My name is Tien. I'm currently living and working in Singapore since 2014 ({{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2014 }} years). I have huge curiosity about everything around me. I build things by code and love to share what I've learned over the years.

I like to connect with people around the world, there's no harm in chatting. You will find me to be a fast learner, self-motivated, organized and hard-working person who is always excited to learn new knowledge.

# Things I’m Good At

## Computers
I have obtained a great deal of professional programming experience in which I have designed, developed and supported real world applications. I mainly writing the back-ends of applications. Most of my experience has been in Java, C# and Ruby; I’ve worked in (or tinkered with) a few other languages too, from time to time.

I like tinkering with code and algorithm. In addition to the coding knowledge, I have experience in doing research as well as preparing reports. Apart from that, I was also trained to have background in computer vision, machine learning and embedded programming.

While most of my experience has been writing back-end code, I’ve also got experiences with front-end coding, infrastructure and enough information to dig into when things inevitably go wrong.

## Quick learning ability
Together with my passion for computer programming, I am hungry for knowledge and having strong desire to utilize this knowledge towards the betterment of the society.

I'm always learning new things because I want to find the best version of myself. I have the ability to teach myself new languages and technologies quickly and often do so out of personal interest outside of work.

I believe every programmer (myself included) will experience a situation where he or she doesn’t know the answer; for me, I will find different resources, talk to the right people, and find the solution no matter what.

## A good team player
Over my career, I’ve worked on teams that have worked incredibly well together, and on teams that have struggled. I have ability to help other developers get better.

I also offer teammates help when they are stuck, teach new skills to others and write documentation that would help teammates not only in their organization but the developer community in general.

Beside from that, I've worked with diverse teams where conflicts would arise, I'm able to navigate and resolve the issue gracefully.

## Solving problems
> "You can never solve a problem on the level on which it was created." — Albert Einstein

Same as everyone, I encounter many problems and challenges in my life including personal and work. But I always keep a positive attitude, and try to use many different approaches to solve the problem.

Normally I will try to identify the issue that I'm dealing with, and define the problem. Then I will brainstorm all possible alternatives, and follow by choosing the best strategy. After that, implement the solution.

That four stages help me to overcome and find the right solution to many problems.
